    "# Content-Based Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on developing a content-based recommender system for the Yelp, MovieLens, and Netflix dataset. Content-based recommendation systems recommend items to users based on the attributes of the items and the user's preferences. Here, we leverage the rich attributes associated with businesses in the Yelp dataset to recommend restaurants to users based on their preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach and Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Preparation**: We begin by loading and preprocessing the datasets, ensuring that it is in a suitable format for building the content-based recommender system.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Next, we perform feature engineering on the datasets, extracting relevant attributes from the business data that can be used to describe each restaurant. (has been done in YELP EDA)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Similarity Calculation**: Using techniques such as cosine similarity, we compute the similarity between restaurants based on their attributes. This allows me to identify restaurants that are similar to each other.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Recommendation Generation**: With the similarity scores computed, we generate recommendations for users by selecting restaurants that are most similar to the ones they have previously liked or rated positively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pandas`: Essential for data manipulation and preprocessing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity`: Utilized to compute cosine similarity between restaurant attributes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`: Used for visualizing the data and similarity scores.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the content-based recommender system involves loading the datasets, performing feature engineering, computing similarity scores, and generating recommendations. Each step is detailed with code snippets and explanations to provide a clear understanding of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation and Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate the performance of the content-based recommender system, we assess its ability to recommend relevant restaurants to users based on their preferences. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy may be utilized to measure the effectiveness of the recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent sections will delve into each stage of the content-based recommender system development, showcasing the implementation details and results obtained.\n",

    "# 1. Dataset Import\n",
    "This code snippet is designed to facilitate the import of datasets for further analysis. Let's break down its functionality step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Input Prompt**: \n",
    "    - The code starts by prompting the user to choose a dataset among \"movielens\", \"netflix\", or \"yelp\". This input is case-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dataset Paths Configuration**:\n",
    "    - After obtaining the user's choice, the code constructs the file paths for the chosen dataset based on a specified base path.\n",
    "    - The base path is predefined as `path`, pointing to the directory where the dataset files are stored.\n",
    "    - Dataset paths are stored in a dictionary named `dataset_paths`, with keys corresponding to dataset names and values representing the full paths to the dataset files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dataset Loading**:\n",
    "    - Using the chosen dataset name, the code retrieves the corresponding file path from `dataset_paths`.\n",
    "    - It then attempts to load the dataset using the `pd.read_parquet()` function from the Pandas library. This function is specifically designed for reading Parquet files, which are commonly used for storing structured data efficiently.\n",
    "    - If the dataset is successfully loaded, the code prints a confirmation message indicating the successful loading of the dataset, along with the dimensions of the loaded dataset (number of rows and columns).\n",
    "    - In case of any error during the dataset loading process, the code catches the exception and prints an error message indicating the failure to load the dataset.\n",

    "# 6 Genre Analysis and Data Transformation for Movie Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we focus on genre analysis and data transformation for two major movie datasets, MovieLens and Netflix. The objective is to refine the datasets to emphasize the top genres, which are critical for further analysis and recommendation model building.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Genre Selection**:\n",
    "   - We begin by defining a list of top genres. These genres are selected based on their popularity and relevance in the datasets.\n",
    "   - A temporary DataFrame `movies_data_1` is created as a copy of the original dataset for manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filtering Top Genres**:\n",
    "   - A custom function `keep_top_genres` is defined. This function filters and retains only the genres listed in our predefined top genres.\n",
    "   - We apply this function to the `genre` column of `movies_data_1`. This step ensures that each movie is associated only with the top genres, simplifying subsequent analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Genre Dummy Variable Creation**:\n",
    "   - Dummy variables are created for each of the top genres. This is done using the `get_dummies` method, which transforms each genre into a separate binary column.\n",
    "   - These dummy variables are then joined with the original dataset, resulting in a new DataFrame `df_with_genres`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dataset Filtering**:\n",
    "   - The DataFrame `df_with_genres` is filtered to include only those rows where at least one of the top genres is present.\n",
    "   - Optionally, the original `genre` column can be dropped, as the information is now encoded in the dummy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ratings Data Analysis**:\n",
    "   - A new DataFrame `ratings_data` is created to analyze the average ratings for each movie.\n",
    "   - This data can be used for further insights into how different genres are rated by the audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Display**:\n",
    "   - The transformed DataFrames `df_with_genres`, `movies_data_1`, and the head of `ratings_data` are displayed for review and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation and filtering process are crucial for focusing the analysis on the most significant genres, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the recommendation systems derived from these datasets.\n"

    "# 7. Ratings Analysis for Yelp Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we focus on analyzing the Yelp dataset, specifically examining the average ratings for restaurants. This analysis is key to understanding customer preferences and the overall performance of restaurants in the Yelp database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conditional Execution**:\n",
    "   - The analysis is performed only if `dataset_choice` is set to 'yelp'. This conditional check ensures that the code is executed specifically for the Yelp dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Average Ratings Calculation**:\n",
    "   - We compute the average ratings for each restaurant. This is achieved by grouping the data by the `name` of the restaurant and then calculating the mean of the `rating` column.\n",
    "   - The result is stored in a DataFrame called `ratings_data`. This DataFrame provides a concise view of the average ratings that each restaurant has received, serving as an essential metric for performance analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Display**:\n",
    "   - We display the top 50 entries from the `ratings_data` DataFrame to get an initial overview of the ratings distribution.\n",
    "   - This display helps in quickly identifying the top-rated restaurants and understanding the general trend in customer ratings across different establishments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is particularly useful for identifying standout restaurants in the Yelp dataset and can guide further detailed exploration, such as identifying factors contributing to high ratings or areas where restaurants can improve.\n"

    "# 8.  Data Preparation for Movie and Restaurant Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "This section involves preparing data for recommendation systems, focusing on two distinct datasets: MovieLens and Netflix for movies, and Yelp for restaurants. The preparation includes resetting indices, dropping unnecessary columns, and restructuring data for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Movie Datasets (MovieLens and Netflix)**:\n",
    "   - **Index Resetting**: First, we reset the index of the DataFrame `df_with_genres` to avoid any future indexing issues. This results in `user_movies` having a clean, zero-based index.\n",
    "   - **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**: We create a DataFrame `user_genre_df` by dropping columns like `itemid`, `title`, `userid`, `rating`, and `year`. This step reduces memory usage and focuses on the relevant data for genre analysis.\n",
    "   - **Creating Genre ID DataFrame**: Another DataFrame `genre_id` is created, indexed by `itemid`, and also drops the same set of columns.\n",
    "   - **Data Inspection**: We print the shapes of both `genre_id` and `user_genre_df` to understand the dimensions of our data, and display samples from these DataFrames for a quick review.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Restaurant Dataset (Yelp)**:\n",
    "   - **Index Resetting**: Similar to the movie datasets, the index of the DataFrame `df_content` is reset, resulting in `user_restaurants` having a fresh index.\n",
    "   - **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**: For restaurant data, we drop columns like `business_id`, `name`, `userid`, and `rating` from `user_restaurants` to create `user_restaurant_attributes`. This focuses the DataFrame on attributes relevant to restaurant analysis.\n",
    "   - **Creating Restaurant ID DataFrame**: A DataFrame `restaurant_id` is created, indexed by `business_id`. It also undergoes a similar process of dropping specific columns.\n",
    "   - **Data Inspection**: The shapes of `restaurant_id` and `user_restaurant_attributes` are printed for dimensional analysis, and samples are displayed for a preliminary inspection.\n"

    "- **Restaurant Recommendations (Yelp)**:\n",
    "   - **Recommendation Score Calculation**: The `get_restaurant_recommendations` function is used to compute scores for the Yelp dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "This section outlines the process of generating top recommendations for both movie (MovieLens and Netflix) and restaurant (Yelp) recommendation systems. It involves combining user profiles with item-specific data to yield a ranked list of suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions to Generate Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Movie Recommendations (`get_recommendation_df`)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: This function calculates recommendation scores for movies by considering both the user's genre preferences and the average ratings of movies.\n",
    "   - **Process**:\n",
    "     - Each genre indicator is weighted by the user's profile.\n",
    "     - These weighted scores are summed to get an overall genre score for each movie.\n",
    "     - The genre scores are normalized and then combined with the average movie ratings.\n",
    "     - The top `n` recommendations are selected based on these combined scores.\n",
    "   - **Return Values**: It returns the top movie scores and the average ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Restaurant Recommendations (`get_restaurant_recommendations`)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Similarly, this function computes scores for restaurants, taking into account the user's preferences and average restaurant ratings.\n",
    "   - **Process**:\n",
    "     - Each attribute is weighted by the user's profile.\n",
    "     - The weighted attribute scores are summed and normalized.\n",
    "     - These scores are then combined with the average restaurant ratings.\n",
    "     - The top `n` recommendations are determined from the combined scores.\n",
    "   - **Return Values**: The function outputs the top restaurant scores and average ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying Functions and Displaying Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Movie Recommendations (MovieLens and Netflix)**:\n",
    "   - **Recommendation Generation**: We use `get_recommendation_df` to generate recommendation scores for movies.\n",
    "   - **Fetching Movie Details**: The details of the top-rated movies are retrieved, ensuring no duplicates and merging with the average ratings.\n",
    "   - **Output**: The top 20 recommended movies, along with their details like title, genre, year, and average rating, are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Restaurant Recommendations (Yelp)**:\n",
    "   - **Recommendation Generation**: The `get_restaurant_recommendations` function is used to calculate recommendation scores for restaurants.\n",
    "   - **Fetching Restaurant Details**: Similar to movies, we retrieve the details of top-rated restaurants and merge them with average ratings.\n",
    "   - **Output**: The top 20 recommended restaurants, including their business ID, name, and average rating, are shown.\n",

    "# Conclusion: Performance Analysis of Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In evaluating the performance of recommendation systems for the MovieLens, Netflix, and Yelp datasets, we employed key metrics: Precision, Recall, and Accuracy. Here's a comprehensive analysis of what these metrics reveal about each system:\n",
    "\n",
    "### MovieLens Dataset:\n",
    "- **Precision (0.0027)**: Indicates a small fraction of recommended movies were relevant.\n",
    "- **Recall (0.6231)**: Suggests the system retrieved a large portion of relevant movies.\n",
    "- **Accuracy (0.6525)**: Reflects good overall performance in predicting relevant and irrelevant movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Netflix Dataset:\n",
    "- **Precision (0.0001)**: Extremely low, implying few recommended movies were relevant.\n",
    "- **Recall (0.3800)**: Moderately effective in identifying relevant movies.\n",
    "- **Accuracy (0.5514)**: Above average but highlights the need for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Yelp Dataset:\n",
    "- **Precision (0.0017)**: Exhibits a low precision rate, indicating that a minimal portion of recommended restaurants aligns with user preferences.\n",
    "- **Recall (0.7733)**: Reflects a substantial capability in retrieving relevant restaurants.\n",
    "- **Accuracy (0.3240)**: Demonstrates a moderate level of accuracy in correctly predicting relevant and irrelevant recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Insights:\n",
    "- **MovieLens vs. Netflix**: Both systems displayed low precision. MovieLens, however, showed better recall and accuracy, suggesting a more balanced approach.\n",
    "- **Yelp's Performance**: Despite its satisfactory recall rate, the low precision in Yelp's dataset indicates a need for enhancing the relevancy of its recommendations\n",
    "- **Improvement Areas**: For MovieLens and Netflix, enhancing precision is crucial. For Yelp, maintaining high standards while expanding or diversifying the dataset remains a focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while the Yelp dataset shows promise in identifying a large portion of relevant restaurants, its low precision highlights an area for potential improvement. Enhancing the accuracy of recommendations could substantially elevate the overall user experience. However, MovieLens and Netflix recommendation systems, particularly Netflix, need refinement to improve precision and provide more relevant recommendations.\n",
