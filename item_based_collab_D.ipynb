    "# Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Movielens\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the concept of Item-Based Collaborative Filtering, an increasingly popular recommendation algorithm. Large enterprises, recognizing the benefits of personalized recommendations, are increasingly investing in research and implementation of recommender systems. How it works?? The algorithm works by finding the similarity between items based on the ratings users have given them. The assumption here is that if two items are similar, a user who liked one item would also likely enjoy the other.\n",

    "- **Random Selection**: Chooses a movie and a user at random to simulate a prediction scenario.\n",
    "- **Similarity Retrieval**: Extracts cosine similarities for the selected movie against all others in the dataset.\n",
    "- **Top-K Similarity Selection**: Identifies the top-K similar movies to the selected one, ensuring the prediction is based on the most relevant comparisons.\n",
    "- **Rating Prediction**: Calculates the predicted rating using a weighted sum of ratings from the top-K similar movies, adjusted by their similarity scores. This method intuitively captures the premise that more similar movies should have a greater influence on the prediction.\n",
    "- **Fallback Strategy**: Implements a fallback mechanism to use the average rating of the selected movie if it's unrated by the user. This pragmatic approach ensures a prediction is always provided, enhancing user experience by avoiding null responses."

    "This code implements an item-based collaborative filtering approach to recommend movies. It utilizes cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movies and predicts ratings using a combination of global averages, user biases, and item biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Item_Item_matrix`: Custom function item_item_matrix calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors, representing the similarity between movies based on user ratings.\n",
    "- `Bias Calculation`: Computes global average rating, user biases, and item biases to adjust predictions and account for systematic tendencies in the data.\n",
    "- `Rating Prediction`: The predict_ratings function predicts ratings for a set of movies (top-k similar items) for a given user, incorporating biases and similarities to generate personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Selects a movie and calculates similarities to all other movies.\n",
    "2. Identifies the top-k most similar movies.\n",
    "3. Predicts ratings for these movies for a specific user, using a weighted sum of the user's ratings adjusted by biases and similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcome Display:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists movies previously seen by the user related to the selected movie.\n",
    "- Shows the top-k recommended movies based on the calculated predictions, including their titles, genres, and the predicted ratings.\n",
    "- This approach enhances the recommendation process by providing more personalized and careful movie suggestions, leveraging detailed user-item interaction data and adjusting for individual and item-specific biases."

    "As an extra I put the `find_movie_by_title`function, which uses `fuzzy string` (package) matching to identify and return the most similar movie title from the dataset based on a given search query. This enhances user experience by allowing for flexible movie searches, even when the exact titles are not known or are misspelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `fuzzywuzzy` package is a tool for string matching that uses Levenshtein Distance to calculate the differences between sequences. It provides easy-to-use functions to compare strings and determine similarity, allowing for partial matches and typo tolerance in text comparison. This makes it particularly useful for searching titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- -----> Levenshtein Distance is a measure of the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one string into another, including insertions, deletions, or substitutions. The Levenshtein Distance was introduced by the Soviet mathematician Vladimir Levenshtein in 1965. He described it as a metric to measure the difference between two sequences, which could be strings of characters, words, or any other ordered elements."

    "### Explanation of Hyperparameter Tuning class\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__init__(self)`: This is the constructor method for the Tuning class. It initializes three attributes (train_data, validation_data, and test_data) to None. This ensures that they exist as attributes of the class from the beginning. This prevents attribute errors when accessing or manipulating them later in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `train_test(self, sample_df)`: This method is responsible for splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets. It takes a sample DataFrame sample_df as input, converts it into a sparse matrix representation, and then performs a 70-15-15 train-validation-test split on it. The training set (train_data) is used for model training, the validation set (validation_data) is used for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set (test_data) is used for final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `evaluate_predictions(self, pred, truth)`: This method evaluates the predictions made by a model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). It takes two inputs: pred, the predicted ratings, and truth, the actual ratings. First, it checks if the inputs are sparse matrices and converts them into dense arrays if necessary. Then, it flattens the arrays, filters out missing values (ratings <= 0), and computes RMSE and MAE based on the filtered predictions and ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `calculate_weighted_knn_prediction(self, train_data, test_data, k=5, metric='cosine')`: This method calculates predictions using a weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNN) approach. It takes train_data (training set), test_data (test set), k (number of neighbors), and metric (distance metric) as inputs. It initializes a KNN model with the specified parameters, fits it to the training data, and computes the weighted KNN prediction for the test data. It uses the inverse of distances as weights and averages the ratings of the K-nearest neighbors to predict the ratings for each test item.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `hyper_parameter_tuning_knn(self, dataset, iterations=10)`: This method performs hyperparameter tuning for the KNN model. It takes a dataset and an optional parameter iterations (number of iterations for tuning) as inputs. It loops over different combinations of hyperparameters (k and metric), where k varies from a predefined list and metric is fixed to 'cosine' (can be altered to different metrics). Within each iteration, it splits the data into training and validation sets, calculates predictions using the weighted KNN method, evaluates the predictions using RMSE and MAE, and records the results. After iterating over all combinations, it selects the best parameters based on the lowest RMSE, prints the best parameters, and returns them."

    "Item-Bases Classification using KNN, `item_item_similarity`, is designed to calculate the similarities between a specific item and other items based on interactions from users. It begins by transforming a sparse matrix that represents these interactions into a dense array for straightforward computation. Following this, the function iterates over each item, excluding the selected one, to compute the cosine similarity between their interaction vectors. It returns a list of tuples, with each tuple comprising the index of another item and the similarity score with the selected item. Subsequently, a random item index is selected, and similarities between this item and others are calculated. The resulting similarities are then sorted in descending order, and the top 20 similar items are presented along with their similarity scores. This process essentially aids in analyzing item-item similarities based on user interaction data."

    "This section examines the outcomes derived from our Item-Based KNN model for Collaborative Filtering. We initiated our investigation using the Movielens dataset as a foundation. Initially, we established a predictive framework based on item similarity. We then used the KNN model to predict the ratings for the top k recommended movies. We then compared the predicted ratings with the actual ratings in the test set and evaluated the model's performance. The evaluation has been done using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).\n",

The results show that Movielens with (filtered data from 25 million for computational efficiency) 3 million data points has a higeher RMSE than Netflix with (filtered data from 80 million for computational efficiency) 8 million  data points. Indicating that the richer the data, the better the performance.\n",
